Define 1.1.1: If $S$ is a nonempty set of numbers in oder of size, $A$ and $B$ are two subsets of it, if they satisfy the following conditions:

1. $A \ne \varnothing, B \ne \varnothing$

 	2. $A \cup B = S$
 	3. $\forall a \in A, \forall b \in B, a<b$
 	4. There is no maximum number in the $A$

And We will call $A$ and $B$ is division of $S$.recorded as $(A|B)$.

Now let's consider the division of rational $Q$.The arbitrary division of $(A|B)$ of $Q$ must occur in one of the following two situations:
