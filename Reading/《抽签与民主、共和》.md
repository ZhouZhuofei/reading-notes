***

> 民主指的是一种让人民（尤其是普通的大众）自己当家做主的政治制度。

Democracy refers to a political system that allows people, especially ordinary people, to be masters of their own affairs.



> 抽签分派官职被看作是民主的，选举则带有寡头政体的性质。 ——亚里士多德

Balloting for offices was considered democratic, and elections had the character of an oligarchy.



> 在抽选中，人人都有当选的可能；而在票选中，只有极少数人是当选机会的幸运儿，所以票选具有内在的精英化倾向。

In a random election, everyone has the possibility of being elected; In the voting, only a few people are lucky to elected, so the voting has an inherent elitist tendency.



> 抽选产生的群体构成人民整体的缩样时，这些群体的思维与行为方式就在相当大程度上成为全体人民的替身。他们比选举产生的群体更具有代表性。

When the selected groups constitute the reduction of the whole people, their ways of thinking and behavior become the substitute of the whole people to a considerable extent.They are more representative than elected groups.
