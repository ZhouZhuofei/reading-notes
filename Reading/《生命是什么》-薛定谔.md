## 生命是什么？(What is Life?)



**Question**

> 发生在生命世界中的事件，怎样用物理学和化学的原理来解释？(How do physical and chemical principles explain events that occur in the living world?)



> 这种事件的发生与时间和空间的关系又是怎样的呢？(How does this happen in relation to time and space?)



> 为什么原子这么小，反之：为什么与原子相比，为什么我们的身体这么大？(Why are atoms so small, and vice versa: Why are our bodies so large compared to atoms?)



> 为什么诸如人类大脑之类的感觉器官以及附属于它的感觉系统必须由大量的原子组成？(Why do sensory organs such as the human brain and the sensory systems attached to them have to be made up of a large number of atoms?)



> 大脑以及它直接与周围环境相互作用的某些外围部分，与一个精致灵敏地反映和记录外界单个原子碰撞的机器相比，为什么它们之间的差异这么大呢？(Why are the brain and some of its peripheral parts, which interact directly with its surroundings, so different from a machine that is exquisitely sensitive to and records the collisions of individual atoms in the outside world?)



1. 思想本身就是一个有秩序的体系 (Thought itself is an orderly system)
2. 思想只能是建筑在有一定秩序性的知觉或经验上的(Thought can only be the building in a certain order of consciousness or experience)
   	1. 思想的秩序性，躯体组织也是一定有秩序(The orderliness of the mind and the organization of the body must be in order)
    	2. 外界物体对于躯体所产生的反应，是思想的资料(The reaction of external objects to the body is the data of thought)

躯体系统和外界物体之间的相互作用具有物理学的秩序性，即它们必须遵循严格、准确的物理学定律。(The interactions between the body system and external objects have the order of physics, that is, they must follow strict and exact laws of physics)



由于原子不停的无序运动，致使少量原子构成的有机体不可能(The ceaseless disordered motion of atoms makes an organism composed of a few atoms impossible)

精确性以大量原子介入为基础(Accuracy is based on a large number of atomic interventions)

有机体的内在生命以及它同外部世界的相互作用，都能被精确的定律所概述，但这个前提是它自身必须有一个巨大的结构。如果没有足够的空间结构，参与合作的分子数目太少的话，“定律”也就不准确了(The internal life of the organism and its interaction with the external world can be outlined by precise laws, but only if it has a huge structure of its own. if there is not enough and too few molecules to collaborate with, the law is not accurate)



有机体和它的全部生物学过程，必须有足够多的原子结构，必须避免出现偶然的单原子事件发挥关键作用。(The organism and all its biological processes must have enough atomic structure to avoid the chance of a single atom event play a key role)



突变由基因分子中的能量跃迁引起(Mutations are caused by energy transitions in gene molecules)

- 突变是单一事件：突变频数的增加量随着射线剂量的增加而不断提升(Mutations are single events: the increase in frequency of mutations increaseses with the increase in the dose of radiation.)
- 事件的局限性：辐射剂量相等，突变系数不变（射线性质不影响）(Limitions of events: radiation dose is equal, mutation cofficient is constant(radiation properties are not affected))



> 基因结构中只有少量的原子，一般是1000个，甚至比这还要少，然而令人疑惑的是，基因的持久不变特性总是有规律地表现出来，那么这两方面相互矛盾的事实该如何通过统计物理学的观点得到解释呢？(The are only a handful of atoms in the structure of a gene, typically 1,000 or fewer, and yet the persistence of genes puzzling beacuse they show up regularly. How, then, can these two contradictory facts be explained from the point of view statistical physics?)



量子的跃迁是指由一种稳定的模型变化为另一种模型。如果后一模型处于较高的能级、具有更为强大的能量，那么要想使得这种转化成为可能，就必须向外界借助相当于两个能级间的能量差额的能量作为动力(A quantum transition is a change from a stable model to another. If the latter model is at a higher erengy level and has more powerful energy, then to make this transformation possible, it must be powered by external energy equivalent to the difference between the two energy levels.) 



除非外界能够提供给分子跳跃到较高能级所需的能量差额，否则它们是具有相当的稳定性的，因而所形成的模型一般不会发生改变。可见，能级差的存在有效地决定了分子的稳定程度。(unless the outside world can provide the difference needed to jump to higher energy levels, molecules are fairly stable, and the resulting model generally does not change. It can be seen that the existence of energy level difference effectively determines the degree of molecules stability) 

发生“跃进”必须等待的平均时间——“期待时间”(The average time you must wait for a "leap forward"——"expected time").

实现“跃进”的机会越小，期待时间就会越长。(The less chance there is of a "leap forward", the longer the anticipation will be.)



 从一种模型跃进到另一种模型，显然只能通过中间模型才有可能发生。（同分异构体）(Jumping from one model to another is obviously only possible through intermediate models(lsomers))

同分异构体有不同的能级，但都是稳定的，由于没有中间模型，为了变换结构，需要具备相当高能量的模型作为中介，否则是没有办法完成跃进的。(Lsomers have different energy levels, but they are stable, and because there is no intermediate model, in order to transform the structure, you need a fairly high energy model as a mediator, otherwise, you can't do the jump)



> 由少量原子组成的分子结构——诸如遗传物质等，它们对于热运动的干扰能否长时间有效地持续抵制？(Can molecular structure made up of a small number of atoms-such as genetic matter-resist the )interference of heat over a long period of time?)

基因分子的实际模型和它的同分异构体分开的阈能远远高于原子的平均热能，以至于使得这种变化成为概率极其低下的罕有事件。这种罕见的变化就是我们常说的基因自发突变。(The actual model of a gene molecule and the threshold energy separating it from its isomers is so much higher than the average thermal energy of the atom that it makes this change an extremely unlikely event. This rare change is what we call a spontaneous mutation of a gene.)



热运动的偶然涨落被我们用来解释自然突变的发生概率，那我们就会释然了。因为自然界对阈值已经作出了微妙的选择，这种选择的微妙必定使得突变的发生概率极其低下。正如前文所说，过多的突变对于进化来说是没有好处的(Accidental fluctuations in thermal motion are used to explain the probability of natural mutations, and we can be relieved. Because nature has made subtle choices about thresholds, the subtlety of such choices must make the probability of mutation extremely low. As mentioned above, too many mutations are not good for evolution)

自然状态下的突变概率很低，突变发生的“期待时间”很长，依赖分子热运动或是宇宙射线形成的突变“期待时间“过长，反之发生的概率过低。(In the natural state, the mutation probability is very low, the "expected time" of mutation is very long, the "expected time" of mutation depending on the thermal movement of molecules or the formation of cosmic rays is too long, and the probability of mutation on the contrary is too low.)





> 生命就是其中一个令人惊异的例子。物质的有序和有规律的行为在生命中得到了完美体现，因为生命从来都是部分地保持现有的秩序，而不是直接地从有序转向无序的自然倾向。(Life is a amazing example of this. The order of matter and the regular behaviour of matter are perfectly embodies in life, for life is aways a partial preservation of the existing order, and not a natural tendency to move directly from order to disorder.)



> 生命有机体是如何避免衰退到平衡的呢？(How do living organisms avoid decay into equilibrium?)

1. 最初大部分人都认为是指物质的交换(At first most people thought it meant the exchange of matter)

生物体中的氧、氮、硫等任何一个原子与环境中的同类原子都是一样的，那么把它们进行交换又有什么意义(Any atoms of oxygen, nitogen, sulfur in an organism is the same as any other atoms in the environment, so what's the point of exchanging them)

2. 有人认为能量是我们赖以生存的基础(Somebody think that energy is the foundation on which we live)

一个成年有机体所含的物质与所含的能量都是固定不变的。既然体外一个卡路里与体内一个卡路里的价值是相等的，那么，这样的单纯交换是为了什么呢，能有什么样的益处呢(The amount of energy and matter contained in a adult organism are fixed. Since the value of Calorie outside the body is equal to that a Calorie inside the body, what is this simple exchange and what are the benefits)



> 自然界中的每一个过程、事件以及突发事变等等，它们在发生的过程中意味着在其中的与之相对应的那部分熵在增加。因此，一个生命有机体无时无刻不在生产着熵或者是在增加正熵，同时它们不断趋近熵的最大值，在这一缓慢过程之后就是生命有机体的危险状态，即死亡。(Every process, event, contingency in nature, and so on, in process of occurring means that the corresponding part of it is increaing entropy. Thus, a living organism produce entropy or increases positive entropy all the time, and they approach the maximum entropy, after the slow process is the dangerous state of the living organism, that is, death.)

$Entropy = klnD$ , k是玻耳兹曼常量（k=1.3806488×10-23J/℃），D是所讨论物体的原子无序性的定量量度(Entropy=klnD, K is Boltzmann constant, D is a quantitative measure of the atomic disorder of the object in question)



一个在均匀环境里的系统或者一个孤立的系统，由于它的熵值在不断增加，因此它会越来越趋近于最大熵的惰性状态(A system in a uniform environment or an isolated system, because it entropy is increasing, is going to approach the inert state of maximum entropy.)



如果D是无序性的量度，那么它的倒数1/D就可以作为有序性的一个直接量度。因为D的负对数恰好是1/D的对数，于是玻耳兹曼方程式可以写成这样:(If D is measure of disorder, so its reciprocal 1/D can ba a direct measure of order. because the negative log of D is exactly the log of 1/D, so the Boltzmann's equation can be written like this:)

$Negative Entropy = kln(\frac{1}{D})$

负熵是一种积极的物质，它是有机体维持生命的重要物质.有机体使其自身维持在一个有序水平的办法，无一不是从外界的环境中汲取这样的序(Negative entropy is a positive substance, which is essential to the life of an organism, and the way in which an organism maintains itself at an ordered level is by drawing such order from external environment)



> 食物中含有的能量的确至关重要，我们的身体消耗的机械能，以及我们不断向四周散发的热，都要求我们必须补充能量。为什么我们赖以生存的不是木炭或者金刚石矿浆，而是“复杂性有异的有机物的非常有序状态中”的物质？(The energy contained in food is indeed vital, and the mechanical energy our bodies expend and the heat we constantly radiate requires that we replenish it.Why do we live not on charcoal or diamond pup, but on "a very ordered state of complex and heterogeneous organic matter?)



在有机体中可能有新的定律(There may be new laws in organism)

物理学的普通定律是无法涵盖生命物质结构的工作方式的。这是因为迄今在物理实验室中研究过的任何一种物质都与生命物质的构造不同，而不是由于在生命有机体内单个原子的行为之外是否存在一个“新的力”在支配着这一切。(The ordinary laws of physics do not cover the way the structure of living matters work. This is because any substence so far studied in physics laboratory is different from the structure of living matter, and not because there is a "new force" governing all this beyond the behavior of individuals atoms in living organisms)

## 意识和物质(Consciousness And Matter)





> 不是每一个神经活动或大脑活动都与意识紧密相随。(Not every neural activity or brain activity is closely associated with consciousness )



不同于往常的改变以及我们对变化作出的反应便顺利地闯入了我们的意识。但是如果这些变化被我们继续不断地重复，它们也将再次从意识中消退。（成为习惯）(Change out of the ordinary and how we react to it smoothly intrudes into our consciousness. But if these changes are repeated over and over again, they will recede from consciousness again(become a habit))

意识中只保留最近才发生的、生物体处于学习或练习阶段的这些变化。(Only these change, which have occurred recently and which the organism is learning or practicing, are retained in consciousness.)

> 它们在几乎没有任何变化或者有规律的变化情况下早已训练有素，因此在意识的领域中找不到它们，例如心脏跳动，胃肠蠕动(They are so well trained to undergo little or no change that they are not found in the realm of consiousness, such as the beating of the heart or the motility of the stomach and intestine.)

> 只要身体的器官调节自身的功能，不断与环境发生作用，意识就会随着这些变化而出现，不断受到环境的影响，经受一定时间的锻炼后，被环境以特殊的方式而修改。(As long as the organs of the body regulate their functions and constantly interact with the environment, consciousness will emerge with these changes, constantly influenced by the environment, and after a certain period of exercise, modified by the environment in a special way.)

> 生物体的学习虽然与意识紧密相关，但是它对学习是怎样发生的却处于一种无意识的状态(Although biological learning is closely related to consciousness, it's in an unconscious state of how learning occurs.)

> 被意识到的只是那些仍旧处于训练阶段的变化；这些变化在将来会成为固定的、无意识的物质遗传上的财富。(Only those changes that are still in the training phase are recognized; These changes will in the future become fixed, unconscious material genetic wealth.)



> 我们对大脑是反映世界的所有思维器官中最高级的观点并没有十足的理由。一种可能性很大的情况是，某个物种与人类的大脑相似，但是它们反映的世界与人类的大脑相比的话，就正如把人脑的意象与狗的相比，或者是把蜗牛反映的世界与狗的相比。(There is no good reason to believe that the brain is the highest organ of thought that reflects the world. One possibility is that a species is similar to a human brain, but they reflect a world that is similar to a human brain, just as a human brain's image is similar to that of a dog, or a snail's world is similar to that of a dog.)

> 法律和制度一方面保护生命，号召人们禁止弑婴，尽量帮助病弱的人生存；但另一方面，它们把后代的数量限制在了生计允许的范围中，这无形中相当于替代了自然选择，抛弃了那些不适应生存者的法则。(Laws and institutions, on the one hand, protect life, call on people to prohibit infanticide, try to help sick people survive; but on the other hand, they limit the number of offspring to a subsistence level, effectively displacing natural selection and abandoning rules that do not suit the living.)

> 鸟儿凭借自己的飞行能力在高高的树梢上筑巢，这样它们的幼仔就不会被其他动物吞食掉。习惯于在这种高度飞行的鸟儿就具有了选择性优势，而这样的高耸住所也必然会选择幼鸟中那些能够飞起来的鸟儿。(Birds use their fight to build nests high in the treetops so their young won't be devoured by other animals. Birds that are used to flying at such altitudes have a selective advantage, and such lofty dwellings inevitably choose the birds among the young can fly)

环境由于这样的飞行能力而有所改变，或者说使得个体的行为不断朝着有利于这样的飞行能力的环境改变。(The environment has changed as a result of this ability to fly, or the behavior of individuals has changed in favor of the environment.)

Behavior plays an important role in evolution.





> 科学从来只是陈述一个事实，它从不强迫人们相信任何事物。对客观事物作出合理恰当的陈述是科学的基本目的。(Science is always just stating a fact, it never froce people to believe anything. The basic aim of science is to make a reasonable and proper statement of objective things)



> 客观性原则，也常被我们戏称为对周围“真实世界的假说”。认知主体被我们排除在自然界之外，而我们自己却扮演一个世界的旁观者，这个旁观者不属于这个世界，于是通过这样的转变，世界就成了一个客观世界。(The principle of objectivity is often called the "hypothesis of the real world" aount us. The cognitive subject is excluded from a natural world by us, while we ourselves act as a bystander of the world. This bystander does not belong to the world, so through this transformation, the world becomes an objective world.)

1. 我们通过知觉、感觉、记忆等构建起来的客观世界中，自然也包括我们自己的身体。(The objective world that we construct through perception, sensation, memory, etc., naturally includes our bodies.)
2. 其他人的身体也是这客观世界中的组成部分。我自己也是构成我的周围物质世界的一部分。(Other people's bodies are also part of this objective world. I myself constitute the physical world around me.)



> 要想获得令人满意的世界图画，我们就必须把自己置于这个画面之外，这样才能使得自己成为一个与这个画面没有关系的旁观者(In order to obtain a satisfactory picture of the world, we must put ourself out of the picture, so that we may become an outsider who has nothing to do with the picture.)

悖论：(Paradox:)

1. 我们发现世界是“无色、冰冷、无声”的。因为既然我们摒弃了个人意识在世界中的位置，那么颜色与声音、冷与热从何而来呢？因为这些元素是我们的直接感觉，而直接感觉是与个人的意识紧密相关的。(We find that the world is "colorless, cold and silent". For now that we have abandoned our place in the world, where do colors and sounds, cold and heat come from? Because these elements are our immediate feelings, and immediate feelings are closely related to individual consiousness.)
2. 我们极力寻求意识与物质的相互作用时几乎是徒劳而已。把我们自己包括我们自己的意识排除在外是建立物质世界的前提；而物质世界中没有意识，因此意识是无法作用或被作用于物质世界的任何部分。(We search in vain for the interaction between consiousness and matters. The exclusion of ourselves, including our own consiousness, is a prerequisite for the creation of the physical world; there is no consiousness in this physical world, and therefore consiousness can't act upon or be acted upon any part of physical world.)



> 通过自身的材料，意识为自然哲学家建造了一个客观的外部世界。只有意识从概念的制造中撤出，把自己排除在外，它才能完成这个宏大的任务。由此可见，客观世界并不包含意识的缔造者。(Though its own material consiousness creates an objective external world for the natural philosopher. Consiousness can accomplish this grand task only if its withdraw from the making of the concept and excludes itself. Thus, the objective world does not contain the creator of consciousness.)

> 作为意识器官的感官产生了建造我们世界的材料，于是每一个人的世界是而且总是他自己意识的产物。(The senses, as organs of consciousness, produce the materials with which our world is constructed, and thus each man's world is and always is the product of his own consciousness.)



我们无法看见一个人的性格和意识（当你观察一个人悲伤流泪，你只能观察到成千上万细胞间的联系在规则电脉冲的搏动下，迅速改变着形态，在神经细胞间瞬间开启和闭合，于是便引起了一系列的化学变化和其他许多未知的变化。我们见到的就是这一切。）事实上你能体验到它们，它们的存在十分真实，但是你就是看不到它们。(We can't see a person's personality and consciousness (when you look at a person sad tears, you can only observe the connection between tens of thousands of cells under the rules of electrical pulses beat, rapidly changing form, instantly opened and closed between nerve cells, and caused a series of chemical changes, and many other unknown. That's all we've seen. )You can actually experience them, they're very real, but you just can't see them.)



> 如果我们将它完全孤立，这时将无法获得对它的任何了解。即使我们只是看着这个物体，它也是受到光的照射然后映射到我们的眼中。由于这种扰动既不是完全不相关的，也不是可以被完全探测的，因此，经历艰辛的努力探索之后，我们对观察的物体总是有一些可以了解到的，也总有一些我们是无法察觉或者我们无法准确描述的。所以，我们无法对物体作出完整的、没有一点缺失的描述。(If we isolate it completely, we won't be able to learn anything about it. Even if we're just looking at the object, it's illuminated by light and then mapped to our eyes. Because such disturbances are neither completely irrelevant nor fully detectable, there is always something we can learn about the objects we observe, and there is always something we cannot detect or accurately describe, after a lot of hard work. Therefore, we cannot make a complete description of the object without any missing points.)



> 到目前为止，我们已经描绘了无数科学世界的图画。然而，我们为什么在这些图画当中找不到感觉、知觉和思考的自我呢？我想原因很简单，用一句话表示就是：因为它就是那幅画面本身。正是由于整个画面就是它本身，所以它无法作为一个部分而被包括进去。(So far, we have painted a picture of the world science. But why do we find in these pictures no sense, no perception, no thinking self? I think the reason is very simple, in a word: because it is the picture itself. It is because the whole picture taht it can not be included as a part.)

> 你的世界和我的世界真的是一样的吗？是不是存在一个更为真实的世界，它不同于我们任何一个人通过感官的内部投射而获得的世界？(Is your world really same as mine? Is there a more real world than any of us can achieve though the internal projection of our sense.)

>  就我们个体自身而言，如果说在我的同一头脑中不可能有超越于原有意识之上的新的意识，那么这简直是一种无意义的重复，因为我们自身就无法想象出相反的情况。(As individuals, it would be meaningless repetition to say that in my same mind there could be no new consiousness beyond the old one, because we ourselves cannot imagine the opposite.)

> 我们经常做梦，就像在演木偶戏一样，我们利用手中的绳子控制着玩偶的言行，牵动着它们的动作，但是我们的意识里并没有意识到我们在这样做。这些众多的玩偶中，只有一个是我自己，是这个正在做梦的人。通过他，我一边表演，一边迅速地对接台词，与此同时我还在怀着焦急的心情等待另外一个人的回答，而不管他是否能够满足我的要求。实际上，我并不能指挥他并让他来依照我的意思来行为。(We often dream, as if in a puppet show, we use the rope in our hands to control the words and actions of the dolls, but we are not aware that we are doing so. Of all the dolls, only one was myself, the dreamer. Though him, as i acted, I answered my lines quickly, while i waited anxiously for the other man's answer, whether or not he met my demands. In fact, i counld not command him and make he behave as i wished)

> 既然我承认意识是唯一的，并且我无法想象头脑中的意识，那么我身体上的所有或部分细胞的意识是怎样整合而成唯一的意识的，或者在生命中的每一刻意识是怎样由它们合成的。不过人们可能会想，既然是细胞联合体构成了每个人的整体意识，那么意识的多重性应该是可以表现出来的。(Since i admit that consiousness is unique, and i cannot imagine consiousness in mind, how consiousness of all or part of the cells of my body is integrated into a single consiousness, or how consiousness is composed of them at every moment of my life. But one might think that since it is the cellular association that makes up the whole consiousness of each individual, the multiplicity of consiousness should be expressed.)

谢灵顿闪烁阀值频率试验

**Sherrington flashing threshold frequency test**

两个观察结果的合并并不是大脑机制中的空间连接造成的……更像是两个观察者分别看到左右两只眼的图像，然后来自这两名观察者的意识合二为一。(The combination of the two observations is not caused by spatial connections in brain mechanisms...It is more like two observers seeing images of the left and right eyes, and then the consiousness from the two observers merging into one.)

> 假如一个考古学家计划重建一座城市或一个年代久远的文化，那么那个时代、那个地方的人们生活、感情、行为、思想、快乐与痛苦都可以成为他感兴趣的东西。然而，如果一个世界已经存在了上百万年，但是却没有人意识到、深思过，这不就是等于这个世界什么都不是吗？它真的存在吗？(If a archaeologist plans to reconstruct a city or an ancient culture, the lives, feelings, actions, thoughts, pleasures and plains of the people of that time and place can be interest to him. However, if a world has existed for millions of years without anyone realizing it or thinking about it, Would not that mean the world is nothing? Does it really exist?)

> 意识扮演的双重角色一直困惑着我们。一方面它是舞台，世界上的所有剧目都在它那里上演，或是一个容器，在这个容器里全世界都被包容进去了，而容器之外没有其他的任何物质。另一方面，我们的意识获得的种种印象，也许真的是不真实的，是靠不住的，意识在匆忙的世界中只是与某一非常特殊的器官——大脑紧密相连。(The dual role of consciousness has always puzzled us. On the one hand it's a stage where all the plays in the world are performed, or it's a container in which the whole world is contained, and there's nothing outside. On the other hand, the impressions which our consciousness acquires may indeed be unreal and unreliable, for in a hurried world it is only bound up with one very special organ, the brain.)



> 我们知道，“前与后”的概念主要基于“因果”关系。(We know that the concept of "before" and "after" is largely based on "cause and effect.")
>
> 事件传播的速度不是无限的，它有一个最高限，正好是光在空气中的传播速度(The speed of the event is not infinite, it has a maximum limit, which is exactly the speed of light in the air)





> 如果没有人的观察测量，纵使有最精确的记录，我们也无法得出任何信息和结论。(Without human observation and measurement, even with the most accurate records, we cannot draw any information and conclusions.)

1. 感觉是所有的科学知识的基础；(Sense is the foundation of all scientific knowledge;)
2. 然而，这样的科学知识中并没有关于感知的成分，因此，它不能解释感觉。(However, there is no element of such scientific knowledge about perception, so it cannot explain feeling.)
