## 1.1 基本问题(Basic Problem)

### 1.1.1 新古典经济学的增长理论的矛盾(Contradictions in neoclassical economic growth theory)



- 外生增长论假设经济增长的规模报酬不变，据此断言经济增长的趋势是趋同。(The theory of exogenous growths assumes that the return to scale of economic growth is constant, so it is asserts that the trend of economic growth is convergence.)
- 内生增长论，假设知识资本的规模报酬是递增的，由此断言经济增长的趋势是发散的。(The endogenous growth theory assumes that the scale return of knowledge capital is increasing, and thus asserts that the trend of economic growth is divergent.)

但是(But):

以前强大的英国被德国，美国超越，现在的中国崛起（没有稳定的收敛和发散，只有大国的此起彼伏）。(Once mighty Britain was overtaken by Germany and the United States, and now China is rising(There is no steady convergence or divergence, only a succession of great powers))



### 1.2.0 Basis Model：Logistic Curve

Basis Model：The competitive models of one variable for logistic growth and two variables for species (technology, industry) are studied.



### 1.2.1 Resources limited

The unlimited growth of neoclassical and the limited growth of ecological economy:

新古典经济学的增长理论假设经济是无限增长的。规模报酬递减、规模报酬不变和规模报酬递增只是增长速度的不同，但是没有上限。隐含的假设是自然资源是无限的。(Neoclassical economic growth theory assumes that the economic grows indefinitely. Diminishing returns to scale, constant returns to scale and increasing returns to scale are only the differences in growth rates, but they are no upper limit. The implicit assumption is that natural resources are infinite.)



### 1.2.2 Market Share And Smith's Theorem

Smith's Theorem: Division of labor is limited by the size of the market.

古典经济学的资源有限和新古典经济学的资源无限的不同约束下，市场竞争的机制有本质的不同。前者竞争的是市场份额，即企业的生存权；后者竞争的是价格机制，即市场价格的趋同机制。(Under the different constraints of the limited resources of classical economics and the unlimted resources of neoclassical economics, the mechanism of market competition fundamentally different. The former competes for market share, that is, the enterprise's survival right; The latter competition is the price mechanism, namely the market price convergence mechanism.)



### 1.2.3 Life Cycle and Metabolic Wavelets

生命周期和代谢小波

某种技术形成的产业 → 生物物种(An industry formed by technology → Biological Species)

规则：增长遵循Logistic curve.so two different species 竞争(Rule: Growth follows Logistic curve. So two different species compete)

结果：共存或优胜劣汰(Result: Coexistence or survival of the fittest)

小波的时间尺度用生物或经济学的术语叫生命周期。生物竞争的结果是共存或优胜劣汰。技术竞争的结果是产业的共生演化或新陈代谢。(The time scale of wavelets is called the life cycle in biological or economic terms. The result of biological competition is coexistence or survival of the fittest. The result of technology competition is symbiotic evolution or metabolism of industry.)



### 1.2.4 the technology structure of industry and origin of excess capacity

产业的技术结构和过剩产能的起源

两种机制(Two mechanisms:)

1. 被新技术淘汰的旧产业的产能成为沉没成本，熊彼特“创造性毁灭”的源头。(Capacity in old industry eliminated by new technologies become suck costs, the source of Schumpeter's "creative destruction".)
2. 新旧产业共存时，新旧产业的产能利用率都低于潜在产能。(When old nd new industries coexist, the capacity utilization rate of both old and new industries is lower than potential capacity.)

古典经济学的微观基础——阿罗-德布鲁模型假设每个产品都有无限长的寿命，和生命世界的经济活动没有关系，只是一个不消耗能量的机器人的乌托邦，等价于经济学中的永动机模型。(The Allo-Debreu model, the microscopic basis of classical economics, assumes that each product has an infinite life span, which has nothing to do with economic activity of the living world, but is a utopia of robots that do not consume energy, which is equivalent to the perpetual motion model in economics.)



### 1.3.1 System Stability And Complexity

系统稳定性与复杂性

系统复杂性和稳定性之间是权衡取舍（trade-off）的关系（越复杂越不稳定，反之）(There is a trade-off between system complexity and stability (the more complex, the less stable))



### 1.3.2 General Smith's Theorem

劳动分工受**市场范围**、**资源种类**和**环境波动**的三重限制。

The division of labor is restricted by the triple limits of **market scope**,**resource type ** and **environmental fluctuation**. 

Example:

1. 资本主义的生产方式首先起源于人口密集、交通方便的河海口岸，因为人口多、市场大，才会促进分工的细化。(The capitalist model of production first originated from the river and sea ports with dense population and convenient transportation. Because large population, large market, the division of labor could be refined.)
2. 科技进步促进开放新能源，人口和市场规模增长。(Scientific and technological progress has promoted the opening up of new energy sources and the growth of population and market size.)
3. 政治经济学关于资本主义寿命的问题。(Political economy on the longevity of capitalism.)
4. 巨大的托拉斯过于复杂，面临环境变化时的不稳定性可能导致系统瓦解(Large trusts are too complex, and instability in the face of changing circumstances can cause the system to collapse)



### 1.3.3 Principle Of Sustainability

生态系统的稳定性与复杂性是一对矛盾。(The stability of an ecosystem is in contradiction with its complexity.)

美国模式的大农场的规模生产虽然提高了生产效率，降低了平均成本，但是破坏了生物多样性，带来了许多意想不到的后果(The large-scale production of american-style large farms, while improving productivity and reducing average costs, has destroyed biodiversity with many unintended consequences)

如何利用现代科技更好地实现规模经济和范围经济的结合，缩小城乡差距、工农差距和脑体力劳动的差距，协调经济布局与生态环境的可持续发展，将是后工业时代的主要任务。(How to use modern science and technology to better realize the combination of scale economy and scope economy, narrow the gap between urban and rural areas, the gap between workers and farmers and the gap between brain and physical labor, and coordinate the economic layout and the sustainable development of ecological environment will be the main task of the post-industrial era.)



### 1.3.4 Cultural Economics

个人主义的文化爱好风险，意在追求最大的机遇；集体主义的文化规避风险，意在追求最大的安全。不同的生态环境塑造了不同的文化行为。(Individualistic culture loves risk and seeks the greatest opportunity; Collectivism culture avoids risks and seeks maximum safety. Different ecological environments shape different cultural behaviors.)

技术选择进一步影响经济制度的特征。例如，农业民族的集体主义文化助长从众行为，牧业和航海民族的个人主义文化助长冒险行为。(Technological choice further affects the characteristics of economic institutions. For example, the collectivist culture of the agricultural peoples encouraged conformity, and the individualistic culture of the pastoral and maritime peoples encouraged risk-taking.)



### 1.4.0 Other Fields Of Economics

新古典经济学的定价模型是边际定价，但边际定价的案例在实践中很罕见。在非均衡发展的条件下，定价机制必须因时制宜。（滴滴打车和互联网，免费或补贴用户的目的是占领市场份额，而非获得短期利润。）(The pricing model of neoclassical economics is marginal pricing, but the case of marginal pricing is rare in practice. Under the condition of unbalanced development, pricing mechanism must adjust measures according to the time. (Didi Dache and the Internet, where users are free or subsidised, aim to capture market share rather than make short-term profits.))

新古典经济学的人性自私假设，违背了生态学、演化生物学、演化生理学和演化心理学的基本知识(The selfish assumption of human nature in neoclassical economics violates the basic knowledge of ecology, evolutionary biology, evolutionary physiology and evolutionary psychology)
新古典经济学的理性人假设，本质上是封闭系统中的孤立人。(The rational man hypothesis of neoclassical economics is essentially an isolated person in a closed system.)



### 1.5.0

人类活动的演化进一步提速。初级农业的发展历时万年，城市国家的发展历时千年，工业的发展仅仅百年，信息技术更新换代的速度从十年缩短到一年左右！新古典经济学的静态均衡视角如何能理解我们所处的时代。(The evolution of human activity has accelerated. The development of primary agriculture lasts for ten thousand years, the development of urban countries lasts for one thousand years, and the development of industry lasts only one hundred years, The speed of information technology upgrading has been shortened from ten years about one year! The static equilibrium perspective of neoclassic economics does not understand our times.)

高科技产品研发和生产的生命周期长短没有确定的规律。航空工业的更新换代要比计算机工业复杂。(There is no definite rule for the life cycle of high-tech product research and development and production. The evolution of the aviation industry is more complex than that of the computer industry.)

说明技术进步越复杂，不确定性越大，政府的产业政策也越重要，因为私人资本难以承担高科技的巨大投资和竞争风险。(It indicates that the more complex and uncertain the technological progress is, the more important the government's industrial policy is, because private capital cannot bear the huge investment and competition risk of high-tech)



​	新古典经济学用随机游走来描写技术进步是有问题的。因为随机游走或布朗运动是典型的扩散过程，不可能产生系统性的技术进步。(Neoclassical economics is problematic in its depiction of technological progress as a random walk. Because random walk or Brownian motion is a typical diffusion process, systematic technological progress is not possible.)

科学技术的发展有如下显著的特征：(The development of science and technology has the following remarkable characteristics:)

1. 科技进步有明确的方向和轨迹，有明确的研究方向。(Seientific and technological progress has a clear direction and track, and a clear research direction.)
2. 实现技术目标的方案有多种方式的竞争，和生物演化的树状模式类似，并不是一条道走到黑。(Solutions to technological goals complete in many ways, similar to the tree-like pattern of biological evolution, rather than going all the way to the dark side.)
3. 每种技术方案瓶颈被突破的时间有很大的不确定性。(There is considerable uncertainty as to when each technical solution bottleneck will be broken.)



​	恰当的比喻是把经济看成一个生命有机体。政府相当于神经系统，市场相当于循环系统，社会相当于骨骼肌肉和其他器官。生命从简单到复杂的演化过程也是神经和大脑的发育过程。任何器官要正常运营，必须同时受到循环系统的支持和神经系统的控制。越复杂的生命，神经系统和循环系统的发育越是复杂，不存在神经系统和循环系统之间的明确边界，只存在两者之间的共生演化。(The appropriate metaphor is to think of the economy as a living organism. The government is the nervous system, the market is the circulatory system, and society is the skeletal muscle and other organs. The evolution of life from simple to complex is also the development of nerves and the brain. For any organ to function properly, it must be supported by the circulatory system and controlled by the nervous system. The more complex the life, the more complex the development of the nervous system and circulatory system, there is no clear boundary between the nervous system and circulatory system, there is only symbiotic evolution between the two.)



新古典经济学描写的自由贸易在高科技领域并不存在。(The free trade described by neoclassical economics does not exist in the high-tech world.)



​	技术的研发阶段主要靠非营利的大学和政府科研机构；在技术可以应用的起飞阶段，引入市场竞争可以加快技术的传播和扩散，但是依然需要政府的市场监管，以避免市场泡沫转化为金融危机和经济危机；在老技术的衰落阶段，更需要政府的调节来减少社会的阵痛。自由放任的资本主义是经济学家制造的乌托邦市场，在工业化国家的历史上并不存在。(The research and development phase of technology is mainly dependent on non-profit universities and government research institutions; In the take-off stage when technology can be applied, introducing market competition can accelerate the spread and diffusion of technology, but it still needs the market regulation of the government to avoid the market bubble turning into financial crisis and economic crisis. In the declining stage of old technology, government regulation is more needed to reduce social pain. Laissez-faire capitalism was a utopian market created by economists and did not exist in the history of the industrialised world.)



## 2.1 Metabolism growth theory

### 2.1.1 Finite growth logistic model and species competition model

需求方看，n是买家的数量（人口数），N^*^是市场规模范围（人口规模边界），它是收入分配的函数。这里的市场规模与人口规模及可支配收入相关。
供给方看，n是产出，N^*^是资源约束，它是既有技术和成本结构的函数。例如，历史上粮食生产的上限，可以通过灌溉技术和肥料的应用增加，也可以通过引入谷物或土豆等新作物增加。(On the demand side, n is the number of buyers (population), and N^*^ is the range of market size (population size boundary), which is a function of income distribution. The size of the market here is related to the size of the population and disposable income.
From the supplier's point of view, n is the output, and N^*^ is the resource constraint, which is a function of the existing technology and cost structure. Historically, for example, the upper limit of food production could be increased through irrigation techniques and the use of fertilizers, or by the introduction of new crops such as grains or potatoes)



最简单的有限增长模型是演化生态学中二次型的逻辑斯蒂模型:(The simplest finite growth model is the quadratic logistic model in evolutionary ecology)


$$
\frac{dn}{dt}=f(n)=kn(N^{*}-n)
$$

sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), reltol=1e-8, abstol=1e-8)

是产出量（人口数），N^*^是资源约束（人口规模），k是产出（人口）的增长率。

- $f'>0,0<n<\frac{N^{*}}{2}$ ,动态递增报酬。
- $f'<0,\frac{N^{*}}{2}<n<N^{*}$, 动态递减报酬。



理论生物学中的的Lotka-Volterra方程:(Lotka-volterra equation in theoretical biology:)

1. 在幼稚期即第一阶段，新技术要存活必须跨越某个临界值（survival threshold）。新技术的规模在达到临界值之前难以存活，所以需要知识产权和对外贸易对于幼稚产业的保护。（In infancy, the first stage, a new technology must cross a survival threshold to survive.The scale of new technology cannot survive until it reaches the critical value, so intellectual property rights and foreign trade are needed to protect the immature industry.)
2. 在成长期即第二阶段，新技术显示其市场潜力，私人资本涌入，市场份额迅速扩张，新发行的股票价格飞涨。在这一阶段，市场竞争是市场扩张的驱动力。然而，要维护建设性的竞争环境。(In the second stage of growth, new technologies show their market potential, private capital pours in, market share expands rapidly and the price of newly issued shares skyrockets. In this stage, market competition is the driving force of market expansion. However, a constructive competitive environment must be maintained.)
3. 成熟期即第三阶段，企业利润下降，产业集中度提高(In the mature period, the third stage, corporate profits decline and industrial concentration increases)
4. 真正的挑战发生在衰退期即第四阶段。一些夕阳产业挣扎求存或破产终结，过去的投资变成巨大损失。股票价格下跌，融资成本上升。是继续投资救命还是壮士断腕（cut-loss strategy），这样艰难的抉择是老产业面临生死去留的问题。(The real challenge is in the recession, phase four. As some sunset industries struggle to survive or go bankrupt, past investments turn into huge losses. Share price fell and financing costs rose. Whether to continue to invest to save lives or cut-loss strategies, such a difficult choice is the old industry faced with the problem of life or death.)



> Why did modern capitalism emerge in Western Europe , but not in China?



人的经济行为归结于价格问题。而描述人类行为所需要的可能不只是一个标量（价格），而至少应是一个向量（例如，质量、市场份额等）或张量，需要很多变量、很高维的相空间来刻画。

> Attributing economic behavior to price.What is needed to describe human behavior may not only by a scalar (price), but at least a vector (for example, mass, market share, etc) or a tensor, which requires many variables and very high dimensional phase spaces to be described.





> Western culture is characterized by the development of technology that consumes Human Resources and saves Human Resources , While Chinese culture is the development of technology that consumes Human Resources and saves Resources.



> An important trigger 0f the industrial revolution in the West was *Black Death*
>
> The plague wiped out about third of the population.The slow recovery of the pastoral population, the soaring price of labor services, the long-term contracts signed by the hired workers devalued the land, the nobles went bankrupt, and the manors collapsed.Therefore, the industrial Revolution took place against the background of the development of labor-saving and resource-consuming technologies.



Ecological environment and technology have great influence on human thought and culture, but human thought and culture react on ecological environment.



Europe economic ->Agriculture and animal husbandry mixed economy -> Meat preservation hard -> need salt and spices -> go Indonesia -> solve Longitude determination problem ->two ways (Time difference determines longitude) -> push The development of mechanics and precision machinery 

-> Calculate the orbit of the planet to determine longitude ->  Astronomy





Complexity increases instability





The reform of state-owned enterprises should not only emphasize profit but underestimate the social construction function of enterprises.



Assumption:
$$
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = kn(N-n) - dn(1-\alpha \frac nN)
$$
$N$: Population size

$n$: People who have mastered the technology

$d$:study ability or How difficult it is to master a technology

$\alpha$:sensitivity(if $\alpha>0$,Measure people's rejection of infamiliar things,when $n$ is small, reject rate so higher; if $\alpha<0$, Measure society's preference for risky behavior. )



when $n$ is small, $\alpha>0$, $n_m > n_s$, $1-\alpha \frac {n_s}N>1-\alpha \frac {n_m}N$



we can solve a equilibrium solution:

$n^* = N\frac{(1-\frac{d}{kN})}{1-\frac{d\alpha}{kN}}$



we can get this : $n^*_{\alpha <0} < n^*_{\alpha = 0} < n^*_{\alpha >0}$

**Conclusion**: ==The balanced population or market size of the individualist culture is smaller than that collectivist culture.==





if we consider a fluctuating environment, we can write this function:
$$
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = kx(N-x) - dx(1-\alpha \frac xN) + \sigma k x \xi_(t)
$$
$x$ is random variable, $\xi(t)$ is the white noise(random perturbation term), $\sigma$ is the variance of the white noise.



we solve :
$x_m = N \frac{1-\frac{d}{kN}-\frac{K\alpha^2}{2N}}{1-\frac{d\alpha}{kN}}, \sigma < \sigma_c$

$x_m = 0, \sigma > \sigma_c$

$\sigma_c = \frac 2k (N-\frac{d}{k})$

- ==if the environment fluctuating $\sigma>\frac 2k(N-\frac dk)$, all kinds of culture will be destoryed.So drastic environment change can wipe out culture.==
- ==The conservative population is more stable than aggressive population, in a fluctuating environment.==



Sustainable economic growth depends on the ability of new technologies to find a new and larger resources to get rid of diminshing returns of old resources.
